Direction of activity: 1. Machine learning, 2. Analyst (universal)

Skills and tools: 1. Python, 2. Pandas, 3. Matplotlib, 4. NumPy, 5. Scikit-learn, 6. Exploratory analysis

Project Objectives: Predict gold aggregate when gold refinement is detected

Project description: It is necessary to build a machine learning model for an industrial company that develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the gold recovery rate from gold ore based on mining and refining data. The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics
